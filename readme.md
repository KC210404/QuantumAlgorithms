# Quantum Algorithms
**As part of curriculum, TIET - 2023**

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various quantum algorithms studied during the curriculum at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (TIET) in 2023. Below is a list of the quantum algorithms covered:

1. **Super Dense Coding**
   - A quantum communication protocol that allows the transmission of two classical bits of information using just one qubit.

2. **Teleportation**
   - A protocol that allows the transfer of a quantum state from one qubit to another, over a distance, using classical communication and quantum entanglement.

3. **BB84**
   - A quantum key distribution scheme that allows two parties to securely share a cryptographic key.

4. **Deutsch-Jozsa**
   - An algorithm that determines whether a function is constant or balanced, demonstrating quantum computational speedup over classical algorithms.

5. **Grover's**
   - A quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup for unsorted database search problems.

The `QuantumAlgorithms.ipynb` file includes the code implementations and explanations for each algorithm. Additionally, individual PDF files for each algorithm's code implementation are provided.
